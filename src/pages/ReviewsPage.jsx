Previously we had very bad experiences with nearby shops who claimed to be Dulha House but are fake and bogus.\n\nAlways find the original shop in the market, named as Dulha House.

    text: "I HIGHLY recommend this place and I am so glad we found them! We wanted a bespoke shirwani for our wedding reception and my husband preferred something simple and classic, but luxurious. We decided to go with a black-on-black embroidered shirwani with a black under-toned gold shawl. We told Dawood Bhai and showed him some pictures as well. He listened to exactly what we wanted and was able to source fabrics accordingly. He was very thorough, communication was amazing, and he even went to the extent to show various samples of fabrics in different lighting via video/pictures so that we could really see the color and get a feel for the material. Prices are very reasonable as well! For the shirwani, matching leather shoes, shawl, inner kurta and pants he told us he needed 3-4 weeks, but got the order ready early and sent it out at the 2.5 week mark as it was an international order. He even took the responsibility to ship it carefully himself so that the shirwani wouldn't get damaged in packaging. By far one of the best customer service experiences I've experienced in Pakistan thus far!",

I ordered through WhatsApp. Dawood bhai se meri tafseel se baat huwi. Unho ne sizing ke mutabik mujhe videos send ki. Measurements mene khud li, bilkull perfect tha sab kuch. He also showed me different options for qulla when i mentioned. And i also wanted to let some things custom made. Itna acha inho ne mujhe samjhaya, har ek cheez saath saath me dikhayi, even pocketsquares mere liye khud market tak gaye lene. Their biggest concern was the sizing measurements. But alhamdoulillah it came out perfectly. Saath me mene shoes bhi liye the. Shoes were also very beautiful, nice quality.\n\nf you are confused about where you should go for your menswear for the weddingdays, pleaseeeeee i highly recommend contacting dulhahouse. They are professional and sweet. They handle everything with great care and love. You will not regret.  ",
